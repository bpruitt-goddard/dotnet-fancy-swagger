# dotnet-fancy-swagger
Show off advanced swagger features:

1. Creating separate documents/definitions for different API purposes
2. Grouping APIs into tags for better discoverability and minimize the information presented to a user with a narrow API use case
3. Only show tags in defined documents/definitions
4. Show all APIs in a fall-back/standard API document/definition
5. Enforce API response codes via static analysis built into build
